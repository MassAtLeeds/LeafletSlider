LeafletSlider - Atyla
=============

This timeslider application is for [Atyla](http://www.atylaship.com/), 
a Spanish sailing boat. It is 30 m long and was hand built using 
traditional techniques to withstand strong winds. 
In the open ocean and with a skilled crew it can average more than 
6 knots.  

The map itself was based on a fork of a demo provided here:
